The UI project was assigned to students to help build their understanding of object-oriented programming principals and become more familiar with the C# programming language.  The task was to develop a house trading app for a small startup company where users could go to view local properties, make bids on the houses, outright purchase them, list houses of their own and view all information relevant to them and their tasks.  We were provided a single library from QUT to manage the menuâ€™s but otherwise everything we made was from scratch.  This particular project had a fairly low amount of complexity and focused primarily on the implementation and how to structure classes correctly to adhere to dynamic programming principals.
