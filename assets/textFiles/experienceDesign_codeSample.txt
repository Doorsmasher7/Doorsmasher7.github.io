The way in which effective visual communication is built into the design of our everyday environment is astonishing beyond belief. In modern society, it is difficult to go anywhere without being in the presence of or directed by the intentional design of those places in some capacity. To better understand this, we asked “What is the experience of dining at a fast food burger restaurant according to Tiger’s theorem of pleasure design?”. We believe that through exploring this question and developing our answer we will be able to meaningfully participate in the evolution of the field. This essay will cover an overview of Tiger’s theorem of pleasure design, an analysis of the interior design of two major burger restaurants in the local area, a deep dive into Psycho-pleasure and how it relates to all of the environments within and finally, recommendations on how the environmental design can be updated for a better customer experience. In order to properly grasp and understand each of the primary points of interaction within these establishments, we must first understand Tiger’s theory of pleasure and the four categories by which it is expressed.


Designers focus on pleasure as a form of enhancing the usability of their products or services (Benyon, 2014, p. 99). For instance, making a product more comfortable or improving the aesthetics are pleasurable aspects. However, designing for pleasure can be vital for businesses to market products (Benyon, 2014, p. 99). It helps companies understand and improve their engagement with their consumers and helps develop products and systems to continue being desired and marketable (Benyon, 2014, p. 99). For this report, we used Lionel Tiger's theory on understanding pleasure in design. This theory of pleasure provides the framework for understanding pleasure in design and interactions, and comprises four categories of pleasure (Benyon, 2014, p. 99). These four dimensions centre around a product's physical, emotional, mental and relational effect on a person (Benyon, 2014, p. 99). The dimensions are ideo-pleasure, physio-pleasure, socio-pleasure and psycho-pleasure (Benyon, 2014, p. 99).
