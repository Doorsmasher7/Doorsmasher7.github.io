With this project we were tasked by a hypothetical client to create a maze editing tool.  Their company has been experiencing an increased demand from their clients and designing the mazes by hand has been taking too long.  To increase the efficiency of their workers the maze app should be able to randomly generate mazes, allow for manual editing, allow for importing of images to be placed within the maze, show the solution to the maze, save and load the mazes and allow the mazes to be exported as a JPG for publication.

When creating this as part of the team, I was tasked with designing the grid management system.  In doing so I implemented a depth-first random maze generation algorithm, an A-Star solving algorithm and had a large part in ensuring that the mazeâ€™s could be saved and loaded in a space efficient manner.  My role within the team was that of a leader and manager and I oversaw the majority of the project ensuring that everything was done one time.  

To ensure that we had made the app correctly, we implemented a number of unit tests to double check the system whenever a change was made.  Through this  we found and  prevented several  bugs and errors that may have otherwise caused fatal errors.
