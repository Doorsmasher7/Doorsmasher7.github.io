As part of my degree, I decided to undertake a Graphic Design minor.  This project was the final project for that minor and the subject focused heavily on teamwork and critical thinking.  While the subject matter is not directly relevant to IT, the underlying skills of deep analysis, research, collaboration and interpretation easily transfer to all manner of problems within the industry.  There were two main projects for this semester, the first being a solo project wherein we were expected to critically break down and understand the visual composition of images to build up our initial understanding of the subject matter.  The second had us working as a team to diagnose the effective design of fast-food restaurants and how their environments may affect customers and modify our experience of the place.  My primary takeaway from the project was how to more carefully take into account and consider interface design for individuals with disabilities (ie. colour-blindness, deafness and poor vision).  

Through this project, teamwork and cooperation was essential to success.  I recognised this early and set about fostering a positive team spirit as early as possible and did what I could to ensure that everyone was heard equally, that nobodies’ ideas were outright discarded, that everyone was assigned an equal amount of work based on what they’re comfortable doing and that all work was completed on time.  Disagreements among individuals regarding the project were usually handled by majority vote as quite a large amount of the content was opinion based subject to different perspectives.  To further the team spirit, many of us were at class before our tutor and I began filling that time with a series of quick board games that I encouraged my group to participate in.  This served as a sort of out-of-work bonding that we all shared and were able to chat about and ultimately strengthened the group.
