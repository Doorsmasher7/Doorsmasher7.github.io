The Sistafam project served as the final year project for me and my team.  Together, we were paired up with an industry partner on behalf of QUT and were tasked with developing their product.  The app itself is a social media app targeted at women going through the stages of pregnancy to foster a positive community of mutual support.

The tech stack had us using the Flutter framework (developed by google, specifically designed for mobile app UI development) using DART.  The framework itself abstracts the majority of the heavy lifting associated with front end development and allowed us to create a professional looking interface without much experience.  The back end we chose was Firebase (which is a backend as a service website) specifically because Flutter and Firebase were designed to work together.  The integration between the two has been set up to be as painless as possible making the No-REL database management extremely easy and tracking our progress to be just so.
